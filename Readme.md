## Delay the Inevitable

## Brainstorming

What is inevitable?
Who is delaying it?

Are you inevitable?
Should you be trying to stop them from delaying it?

Are you stopping the inevitable?

Space ship

Running out of fuel
Running away from the enemy
Asteroids
Dodging the asteroids

Overwhelmed by zombies
Enemies

Not dropping the ball

This theme seems amenable to games where you try doing something for as long as you can

Paint drying

Keeping something aloft

Not crashing into a mountain
Hang gliding

Racing game
Strategy game
Puzzle game
Platformer game
FPS game

A plethora of inevitable things, you progressively have to prevent all of them

Economic game
Prevent the collapse
Prevent being overtaken by the competition

Clicker game

Strategy
Real time
Turn based

Turn based
movement, tactical
Running away?

Painting into a corner

Carefully paint rooms so you don't paint yourself into a corner
Have special moves occasionally so you can hop over paint
Tile based game
Maybe a card based action sequence
Welcome to yet another puzzle game

Fishbowl

Inevitably, the larger fish will eat the younger
So make sure to spawn lots of smaller fish
And maybe grow larger fish off of those smaller fish
And maybe eventually take on the larger fish

A bit obscure and not too obvious
Also what is the mechanic?

Spawning fish?
Moving them around?
Point and click
Collect the resources while avoiding the large fish?

As you grow your swarm of fish, it becomes less easy to hide
And you score based on how many fish you were able to collect

Requires AI fish
Difficult to get the graphics right
How do you hide?
How punishing should it be? Eat one, death? Eat many death?
Any recovery possible?

Space station
Run out of air eventually
Have to pressurize one compartment at a time to get through
Make it to the escape pod before it all crashes and burns
Maybe try to escape with various things
Some things delay the destruction
But if you're caught in the station, it all goes down

Top down
First person

Content heavy
Simple gameplay, perhaps

Maybe physics based things though, could be complex

Spaaaaaaace!

River goes to a waterfall
How many things can you collect?
How fast can you go up river
Collect the fuel to speed up

Simple
Requires water

Tower defense

Delay the inevitable
It'll be a puzzle game

## Concepts

### Empire Garden

Strategy game

Progressively build your empire before its inevitable doom

Build different buildings to improve your empire
Stave off barbarians
Stave off starvation
Stave off traders

The more you grow, the more food you eat
The longer the game goes, the more barbarians attack
The more you produce, the more traders come

If you're not big enough, the barbarians destroy a building
If you don't produce enough food, you shrink
If you don't have enough markets, the traders turn into barbarians

Key mechanics:
Placing buildings
Aggregating resources
Barbarians and traders moving into associated buildings
Population moving to interact with invaders

Pros:
Static world, with not too much intelligence
Scaling seems obvious and self perpetuating
Simplish graphics

Cons:
Might be too simple to be fun
Relies on interesting strategic choices, but is likely to boil down to "now build this"
Needs some variety to make interesting

### Capital Ship Defense

Capital ship

Inevitable destruction
Inevitable fuel loss
Inevitable colonization
Inevitable getting lost in space

The aliens are attacking your space station
As they do
You must defend it for as long as possible
You've been promised reinforcements
But you know how reliable your leaders are
Destruction is inevitable

Key Mechanics:
Flying around
Shooting using the mouse
Enemies attacking your space station
Enemies attacking you
Shields need recharging
Armor loss leads to death
Health bars

Requires enemy AI
Requires spaceship models
Requires spacestation model
Requires explosions
Requires lasers
Requires space sphere

Tonight design and ships/station holders
Sat Morning ship movement and shooting and camera
Sat Afternoon enemy ship AI and attacking station
Sat Evening destruction, waves, and scoring, UI
Sun Morning not much
Sun Afternoon art and music
Sun Evening ship
